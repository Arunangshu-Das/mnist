# MNIST Dataset Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains code for training a model to classify images from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is included in the PyTorch library and can be easily loaded using the torchvision package. The dataset is split into training and validation sets, which are used for training and evaluating the model, respectively. The images in the dataset are normalized and resized to a standard size.

## Model Architecture

The model used for this classification task is a simple neural network with a single linear layer. The input size of the model is 784 (corresponding to the flattened image size), and the output size is 10 (representing the 10 possible classes - digits 0 to 9). The model is defined as a subclass of `torch.nn.Module`, and the `forward` method specifies how the input is processed through the network.

## Training

The training process involves iterating over the training dataset for a specified number of epochs. During each epoch, the model is trained on mini-batches of images and labels. The training step involves forward propagation to generate predictions, calculating the loss using cross-entropy, and updating the model parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent optimization. The training progress is monitored using a validation dataset, and the validation loss and accuracy are calculated at the end of each epoch.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the validation dataset to measure its performance. The `evaluate` function calculates the validation loss and accuracy by iterating over the validation dataset and calling the `validation_step` and `validation_epoch_end` functions.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that PyTorch and torchvision are installed.
2. Define the model architecture and hyperparameters (e.g., number of epochs, learning rate).
3. Load the MNIST dataset and create data loaders for training and validation.
4. Create an instance of the model.
5. Call the `fit` function, passing the model, data loaders, and hyperparameters.
6. The training progress will be printed, and the validation loss and accuracy will be displayed for each epoch.

Feel free to modify the code as needed and experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve better performance on the MNIST dataset.
